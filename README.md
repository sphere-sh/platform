# Sphere Platform

Sphere is a modular platform built to run and scale complex applications across distributed environments. It offers a robust runtime environment, service orchestration, and a unified API layer to manage the entire ecosystem.

## Platform Structure

Sphere organizes its ecosystem using real-world geography as a metaphor for logical structuring. This helps teams understand, build, and scale complex systems with clear boundaries and contextual organization.

Each level in the hierarchy represents a different scope of control, abstraction, or responsibility—ranging from high-level governance to individual service units.

## Hierarchical Components

### 🌌 Universe

The **Universe** is the topmost layer of the platform—a collection of **Planets** that are interconnected, yet independently operable. One master Planet within each Universe is responsible for alignment, coordination, and oversight across the ecosystem.

Use case: A Universe might represent an entire enterprise or a globally distributed system of systems.

### 🪐 Planet

A **Planet** is a fully functional, independent instance of the Sphere platform. It includes its own resources, environments, and service layers.

Use case: Planets can be used to isolate different environments (e.g. production, staging) or business domains.

### 🌍 Continent *(Coming soon)*

**Continents** are high-level organizational layers that group related **Countries** together. They help establish boundaries between large domains within a Planet.

Use case: Separate departments or regions like "North America Ops" or "Platform Services."

### 🏳️ Country *(Coming soon)*

A **Country** is a focused area of operation, representing a team, domain, or function. Each Country governs its own structure, policies, and services.

Use case: An individual team or product unit working within a larger Continent.

### 🏙️ State *(Coming soon)*

**States** manage related operational zones within a Country. They serve as containers for Cities and below, enabling local governance and customization.

Use case: Sub-divisions within a department, like mobile vs. web operations.

### 🏘️ City *(Coming soon)*

A **City** clusters multiple **Towns**, acting as an activity hub for cohesive groups of services or initiatives.

Use case: A feature set or tightly integrated suite of tools.

### 🏡 Town *(Coming soon)*

**Towns** contain related **Villages**. They are mid-level organizing layers—ideal for managing small projects, experiments, or service groups.

### 🧩 Village *(Coming soon)*

A **Village** groups together **Neighborhoods**, representing small ecosystems or tightly coupled modules.

### 🏘️ Neighborhood *(Coming soon)*

**Neighborhoods** contain multiple **Blocks**, often grouped by use case, deployment scope, or functionality.

### 🧱 Block *(Coming soon)*

**Blocks** are clusters of components, like service bundles or application modules.

### 🛣️ Street *(Coming soon)*

**Streets** are pathways—representing connections, interactions, or flows between different parts of the system.

Use case: Message buses, APIs, or job queues.

### 🏠 Unit *(Coming soon)*

**Units** are the smallest deployable parts of the platform. These might be services, containers, functions, or lightweight processes.

## Why It Matters

This structure gives teams:

- **Clarity** — Intuitive, real-world naming
- **Scalability** — Easily map your organization’s growth
- **Modularity** — Build and deploy with flexible boundaries
- **Governance** — Apply policies at the right level of control

As the platform evolves, more components will be activated and documented to help you unlock the full power of Sphere.

**Coming soon:** Interactive tooling, visual explorers, and API access for every layer of the hierarchy.
